## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.15+
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 19.20+)
- Git
- CLion IDE (recommended) or any C++ IDE

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/AareonJackson/SlotMachineGame.git
   cd Slot-Machine
   ```

2. Initialize and update submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

3. Generate build files with CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

5. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./SlotMachine
   ```

### Using CLion

1. Open CLion
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the cloned project directory
3. CLion will automatically detect the CMake configuration
4. Click the build button or press Shift+F9 to build
5. Click the run button or press Shift+F10 to run

    "max_bet": 100.00,
    "rtp_percentage": 96.5
}
```
